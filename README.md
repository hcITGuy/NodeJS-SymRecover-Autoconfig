# NodeJS-SymRecover-Autoconfig
A NodeJS-based script to start SymRecover, the little-known binary shipped with Symmetrix Solutions Enabler to restart suspended SRDF sessions.

This script has important variables in both index.js and 'symrecover_runfile' which need to be adjusted prior to attempting to use this script.
